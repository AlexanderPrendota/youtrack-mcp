## Timeline Update

Based on the progress so far, the original timeline appears accurate:

- Phase 1 (Setup and Configuration): ✅ Completed
- Phase 2 (YouTrack API Client): ✅ Completed (Issues, Projects, Users, and Search API done)
- Phase 3 (MCP Server Implementation): ✅ Completed for current tools
- Phase 4 (Testing and Documentation): ⚠️ Partially completed (Basic tests done, integration tests pending)
- Phase 5 (Deployment and Distribution): ✅ Largely completed (Docker and pip packaging done, PyPI publishing pending)

We are on track to complete the remaining components within the originally estimated 7-11 days.

## Lessons Learned

- The MCP tooling ecosystem is still evolving, which means we need to ensure our implementation stays compatible with the latest standards.
- YouTrack API has comprehensive coverage, but we need to carefully handle authentication and permissions.
- Structured error handling is critical for providing meaningful feedback to AI assistants using our tools.
- Consistent naming conventions for tools help create a more intuitive and user-friendly API.
- Robust retry mechanisms help improve reliability when dealing with network-related issues.
- Properly packaging a Python application makes it easier to distribute and deploy.

## Conclusion

The foundation for the YouTrack MCP server has been successfully implemented. We have a working server with basic issue, project, and user management capabilities, as well as advanced search functionality. The package can now be distributed via both Docker and pip. The next phases will focus on adding more API coverage, improving testing, and preparing for production deployment.
